Hello there!!
I am Yukti Sharma and you're currently in my In-Campus OJT Tasks repository 
I have attached all the major tasks I've completed including the Projects I've made 
So basically there are # projects I've made 
1-Autono (a car selling Website)
2-Silver Oak Clone ( made the clone of my university official website for advance practice )
3- Crispy Kitchen (it is a template from Tooplate I've created almost the exact copy of it)
